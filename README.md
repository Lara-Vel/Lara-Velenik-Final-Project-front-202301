#### Technologies Used

üî∏ The front-end of the application is built using React (https://reactjs.org/) with TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety and better developer experience.

üî∏ To handle client-side routing, the react-router-dom npm package (https://reactrouter.com/en/main) is used.

üî∏ To maintain code quality and consistency, we use the following tools:

Husky (https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/): Git hooks to automate tasks like code linting and formatting on pre-commit and pre-push.
ESLint (https://eslint.org/): A pluggable linter for JavaScript and TypeScript that helps identify and fix issues in the codebase.
Prettier (https://prettier.io/): An opinionated code formatter that ensures code consistency and makes it easier to read and understand.
SonarCloud (https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/): A cloud-based code quality and security analysis platform that checks the codebase for issues and vulnerabilities.
EditorConfig (https://editorconfig.org/): A configuration file that helps maintain consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs.

üî∏ For testing purposes, we use:

React Testing Library (https://testing-library.com/): A lightweight and simple testing utility that allows us to test React components in a user-centric way.
Jest (https://jestjs.io/): A testing framework that provides easy-to-use tools for unit and integration testing, with features like mocking, assertions, and snapshot testing.
Mock Service Worker (https://mswjs.io/): A library for mocking API requests and responses that allows us to test our app's behavior under various network conditions.
We strive to keep our codebase clean, organized, and maintainable, and these tools help us achieve that goal.
